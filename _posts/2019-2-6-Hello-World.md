title: A Career of Learning and Deploying!
---

Welcome to my living resume. It's constantly updated because I'm always learning, researching, improving upon my skills, and gaining work experience. See in order to find better and efficient solutions you have to keep learning and gaining experience. Check out the about page above to see my 20+ years of experience and you can check my repo for the myriad of things I have been working on. Although I am migrating more to software dev, "all" of my skills have to be constantly refreshed, so I don't have degradation of the brain.

Effective Data Management<br>
Getting reliable instrumentation is THE most critical thing a 1st data person does. It is an endless journey, from picking frameworks (multiple) to collect system and user data, making sure engineers learn how to implement things without counting errors (which are so easy to make), making sure the databases and logs are doing the Right Thing, and making sure you’re counting what you think you’re counting.

My Love for football & technology<br>
I have an insatiable love for football and technology. So much so it fuels me to develop better coaching process to drive teams toward success. I am constantly looking for ways to modernize a process and have the "machines" help the process.

<h3>Career</h3>
<br>
<h4>Data Mining/Block Chain Researcher/Developer</h4>
<p>2018 - Present</p>
<p>Working to provide blockchain solutions for companies. From the server to software development.  Concentrating on the software development for the last three years fully learning multiple programming languages. I see finding solutions for companies may include writing software on different platforms. Having a general overview of different programming languages, makes me efficient in finding solutions for companies. My early career included learning many different skills while finding a solution. (working on networks, servers, and software). Check out the about <a href="https://althetinkerer.github.io/about/">click here</a> for a list of my technical skills. Also, check out my repos for previous and current work.

<h4>Data Analysis/Machine Learning/Computer Vision Researcher for Youth Sports(Tackle Football)</h4>
<p>Palmetto Bay Broncos</p>
<p>March 2016 - November 2016</p>  
<p>Formed the hypothesis "If we take a team where a majority of kids have never played can we win?" The first you have to do with any organization is take a look at the numbers in the industry. What makes you successful, where are you weak, where are you strong. Taking that data on each player and assigning a position based on physical and mental attributes. I know it seems a bit much to put so much work in to 
<ul>
  <li>Created heat maps in using python and images</li>
  <li>Using OpenCV and machine learning to recognize and detect formations using tensorflow</li>
  <li>Animating our games with R, Python, Matplotlib and Pandas</li>
  <li>Reviewing a game using OpenCV to follow a specific player hotspoting zones on the field</li>
  <li>Extracting film data from Kinovea</li>

<ul>  
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Director of IT Operations</h4>
<p>Immunity, Inc</p>
<p>2009 - 2016</p>  
<p>This is another one of the "best" jobs on my list. I learned to excel at security in this role. This was a Linux shop with some Mac machines floating around. This another smaller shop that specializes in "Offensive Security". So, there was plenty of opportunities to work on offensive security, while my department was the "defensive" part of the company. Most companies concentrate what they specialize in and because we were dealing with security. We only had a small list of trusted vendors, so basically everything had to be done in-house. This means you have to have someone who can perform those "in-house" IT duties. One of the perks of working with an offensive security company is you get to demo things against your network. I also demo's software for our customers. I was able to be opened up to some exploit work, malware analysis, social engineering, windows exploitation, and wireless exploitation. This allowed me to get a better grasp providing security to hardware, networks(mobile, phone, routing), programming techniques(scripting, application and web), and applications. The skills here not only allowed me to improve my "defensive", it also gave me a set of "offensive" skills I use today.

<p>After working in many datacenters and telcos around the companies with the previous two employers, I worked with a small data center in the center of three huge datacenters in downtown Miami. In this role of director, I reported directly to the owner of the company. We managed hundreds of customers on Level 3 and Cogent. Some of our biggest vendors were FPL Fibernet, IPTV, NAP of the Americas, Brands Institute, and AT&T, for some of the first Metro Ethernet rollouts to commercial business in Miami (one of the first resellers). We also helped FPL Fibernet on their rollout of their fiber services to buildings in downtown Miami. Digiport s where I wrote some of my first web apps in Django. My usual protocol of managing networking(BGP, iBGP and OSPF), cloud storage, and VoIP. The owner was very data driven, and so this was a perfect fit for all of my skills (programming and networking). I worked with a lot of services and companies that were "early adopters of different technologies". These were great experiences because I was working with emerging technologies and supporting some really interesting companies. When they could not figure something out, they would bring me on to help engineer a solution.

<h4>Network Engineer</h4>
<p>InterOP</p>
<p>2003</p>
<p>I wanted to volunteer and work with and gain experience from the best network engineers in the industry. Based on my co-workers advice, this was the best event to work as a network engineer. They'd all worked it on their path to becoming great network engineers. This experience really catapulted me to working even harder on learning my craft. I didn't volunteer again, but it gave me some great training,resources, and tips to help me in my career.
<br>
<br>
<h4>Telecom(VoIP), Security, Linux, & Network Engineer/Software Developer</h4>
<p>Priority Networks(Internet Service Provider)</p>
<p>2003 - 2005</p>  
<p>A small, but very resourceful ISP provider that provided "quality" over quantity to provide the best customer experience in the nation. I originally applied to this job looking for a job that worked with bleeding edge technology. I actually received a better personal growth experience from my time here. I had to establish a very good "base" here learning the "how it works", because at some point we would eventually have to troubleshoot "where the packet left and where did it go". The Vice President of Engineering was adament about details and continuous learning which is what I still harp on today. I call this the McGyver job, because at times we had to think "out of the box" to make things works from programming to networking. We worked with regular companies all the way to providing service for the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/">Organization of the American States</a> to Wheel of Fortune. This is actually one of the greatest jobs on my list.

<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4>Data Analyst/Telecom & Network Engineer/Software Developer</h4>
<p>Precision Response Corporation</p>
<p>1998 - 2003</p>
<p>This was actually my first real world data analysis job. Through contract I worked with Mutual Energy, AT&T, Visa Smart Card, FedEx, and Lucent Technologies. Although Excel didn't have the power it does today, it was a very powerful tool for generating call center data. I also worked in software development using Visual Foxpro to build a forecasting tool on a team of software engineers. I had a background in telecom working with my father (40 years with AT&T) in the summers before graduating high school, so as the company grew I migrated toward telecom. I was asked to move over due to my analytical skills and join a team of hybrid software developers/voice engineers. PRC was beginning to migrate from the Lucent PBX phone system to VoIP on some accounts. The many roles, technologies, and companies I worked with was a great starter for my career.<br>
