---

Welcome this is my living resume. It's constantly updated because I'm always learning, researching, improving upon my skills, and gaining work experience.
See in order to find better and efficient solutions you have to keep learning. Check out the about page above to see
my 20+ years of experience and you can check my repo for the myriad of things I have been working on.

<h3>Career</h3>
<br>
<h4>Block Chain Researcher/Developer/Investor</h4>
<p>2017 - Present</p>
<p>Working to provide technology solutions for companies. From the server to software development.<br>
  Concentrating on the software development for the last three years fully learning multiple programming<br>
  languages. I see finding solutions for companies may include writing software on different platforms. Having<br>
  a general overview of different programming languages, makes me efficient in finding solutions for companies.<br>
  My early career included learning many different skills while finding a solution. (working on networks, servers, and <br>
  software). Check out the about <a href="https://althetinkerer.github.io/about/">click here</a> for a list of my technical<br>
  skills. Also, check out my repos for previous and current work.

  <h4>Data Analyst/Telecom & Network Engineer/Software Developer</h4>

  <p>1998 - 2003</p>
  <p>This was actually my first real world data analysis job. Through contract I worked with Mutual Energy, AT&T, Visa Smart Card,<br>
    FedEx, and Lucent Technologies. Although Excel didn't have the power it does today, it was a very powerful tool for<br>
    generating call center data. I also worked in software development using Visual Foxpro to build a forecasting tool<br>
    on a team of software engineers. I had a background in telecom working with my father (40 years with AT&T) in the summers<br>
     before graduating high school, so as the company grew I migrated toward telecom. I was asked to move over due to my analytical<br>
    skills and join a team of hybrid software developers/voice engineers. PRC was beginning to migrate from the Lucent PBX phone<br>
    system to VoIP on some accounts. The many roles, technologies, and companies I worked with was a great starter for my career<br>
