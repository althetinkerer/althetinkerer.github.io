title: Finding Solutions Using Data!
---

Welcome this is my living resume. It's constantly updated because I'm always learning, researching, improving upon my skills, and gaining work experience. See in order to find better and efficient solutions you have to keep learning and gaining experience. Check out the about page above to see my 20+ years of experience and you can check my repo for the myriad of things I have been working on.

Effective Data Management<br>
Getting reliable instrumentation is THE most critical thing a 1st data person does. It is an endless journey, from picking frameworks (multiple) to collect system and user data, making sure engineers learn how to implement things without counting errors (which are so easy to make), making sure the databases and logs are doing the Right Thing, and making sure you’re counting what you think you’re counting.

<h3>Career</h3>
<br>
<h4>Block Chain Researcher/Developer/Investor</h4>
<p>2017 - Present</p>
<p>Working to provide technology solutions for companies. From the server to software development.<br>
  Concentrating on the software development for the last three years fully learning multiple programming<br>
  languages. I see finding solutions for companies may include writing software on different platforms. Having<br>
  a general overview of different programming languages, makes me efficient in finding solutions for companies.<br>
  My early career included learning many different skills while finding a solution. (working on networks, servers, and <br>
  software). Check out the about <a href="https://althetinkerer.github.io/about/">click here</a> for a list of my technical<br>
  skills. Also, check out my repos for previous and current work.

  <h4>Data Analysis/Machine Learning/Computer Vision Researcher for Youth Sports(Tackle Football)</h4>
  <p>Palmetto Bay Broncos</p>
  <p>March 2016 - November 2016</p>  
  <p>Formed the hypothesis "If we take a team where a majority of kids have never played can we win?"<br>
  The first you have to do with any organization is take a look at the numbers in the industry. What makes<br>
  you successful, where are you weak, where are you strong. Taking that data on each player and assigning a<br>
  position based on physical and mental attributes.

  <h4>Telecom(VoIP), Security, Linux, & Network Engineer/Software Developer</h4>
  <p>Priority Networks</p>
  <p>2003 - 2005</p>  
  A small, but very resourceful ISP provider that provided "quality" over quantity to provide the best customer experience in the nation. I originally applied to this job looking for a job that worked with bleeding edge technology. I actually received a better personal growth experience from my time here. I had to establish a very good "base" here learning the "how it works", because at some point we would eventually have to troubleshoot it ourselves. The Vice President of Engineering was adament about continuous learning which is what I still harp on today. I call this the McGyver job, because at times we had to think "out of the box" to make things works from programming to networking. We worked with regular companies all the way to providing service for the <a href="http://www.oas.org/en/"Organization of the American States</a> to Wheel of Fortune. This is actually one of the greatest jobs on my list.

  <br>
  <h4>Data Analyst/Telecom & Network Engineer/Software Developer</h4>
  <p>Precision Response Corporation</p>
  <p>1998 - 2003</p>
  <p>This was actually my first real world data analysis job. Through contract I worked with Mutual Energy, AT&T, Visa Smart Card, FedEx, and Lucent Technologies. Although Excel didn't have the power it does today, it was a very powerful tool for generating call center data. I also worked in software development using Visual Foxpro to build a forecasting tool on a team of software engineers. I had a background in telecom working with my father (40 years with AT&T) in the summers before graduating high school, so as the company grew I migrated toward telecom. I was asked to move over due to my analytical skills and join a team of hybrid software developers/voice engineers. PRC was beginning to migrate from the Lucent PBX phone system to VoIP on some accounts. The many roles, technologies, and companies I worked with was a great starter for my career.<br>
    To summarize here are my real-world work experiences:
  <ul>
    <li>Data Analysis with Excel</li>
    <li>VBA programming for Microsoft Office Products(Mostly Excel)</li>
    <li>SQL database w/Access management for Data Analysis</li>
    <li>Crystal Reports Programmer</li>
    <li>Scripting with Perl to monitor agents on calls</li>
    <li>Network Administrator with Cisco equipment</li>
    <li>Lucent Voice Administrator</li>
    <li>VoIP researcher/engineer (this was the very early phase of integrating VoIP)</li>
    <li>Software development on the AT&T RCAM system</li>
    <li>Software development on pager (yes! I did say pager) platform to notify managers and executives</li>
    <li>Windows Administration and Windows system programming for Visa Smart Card</li>
    <li>Bash Scripting for Windows</li>
    <li>Visual C++ (Visual Studio 6.0) Programming for Windows System Programming (development of in-house applications)</li>
    <li>Windows 2000 Server Administration
  </ul>
